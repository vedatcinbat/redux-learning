-- Redux Notes --
-> Redux is a predictable state container to JavaScript apps
-> It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different 
environments, and are easy to test
-> Redux centralizes your application's state and logic, enabling powerful capabilities
like undo/redo, state persistence, and more

* Core Concepts of Redux
-> Single Source of Truth
--> The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store
--> This means there's only one state container (the store) for your entire application

-> State is Read-Only
--> The only way to change the state is to "emit an action", an object describing what happend
--> This ensures that no component can directly modify the state, which helps in maintainin
consistency

-> Changes are Made with Pure Functions
--> To specify how state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers
--> A reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns 
the next state

* Key Elements of Redux
1. Store
-> The store is the central container for the state in a Redux application. It holds the 
entire state tree of your application
-> There is only one store in a Redux application

2. Actions
-> Actions are plan Javascript objects that describe what happended in your application
-> Every action must have a "type" property that indicates the type of action being performed
-> The "type" should typically be defined as a string constant

const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';

const incrementAction = {
    type: INCREMENT
}

3. Reducers
-> Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments
and return a new state
-> They specify how to state changes in response to an action

const initialState = {value: 0};

function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
    switch(action.type) {
        case "INCREMENT":
            return {value: state.value + 1};
        case "DECREMENT":
            return {value: state.value - 1};
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

4. Dispatch
-> The "dispatch" function is used to send actions to the store. This is the only way to 
trigger a state change

store.dispatch(incrementAction);

5. Selectors
-> Selectors are functions that extract, derive, or compute specific pieces of data from the 
Redux state

const selectValue = state => state.value

6.Middleware
-> Middleware provides a way to extend Redux with custom functionality
-> It sits between the dispatching of an action and the moment it reaches the reducers
-> Common use cases include handling asynchronous action like API calls and logging
-> Example middleware: redux-thunk | redux-saga

When to Use Redux
Redux is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

Complex State Logic:

When the state logic is complex and involves many interactions across different parts of the application.
Predictability:

When you need predictable state management with clear rules on how state can be changed.
Debugging:

When you need powerful debugging capabilities, such as time-travel debugging, where you can go back and forth through the history of actions and state changes.
State Sharing:

When you need to share state across many components or deeply nested components.

### Udemy Course: Ultimate Redux Course ##############################################
* What is Redux ?
-> Redux is a "state management" library for JavaScript applications
-> In other words, redux is used to manage data or state of "complex JavaScript applications"
-> You can you Redux with React, Angular, Vue, JavaScript
-> Centralize application's state
-> Data-flow transparent
-> Easily debug applications
-> Preserve the page state


* When we need Redux ?
-> Comples User interfaces in terms of data like facebook, amazon
-> Data flow is complex

---> When we dont use Redux
-> Small or medium size of applications
-> Simple UI & static data


* Setting up developmnet Environment
-> Webpack: is the bundler for bundle our JavaScript code in one file and then link with our browser
-> In simple words, we can write our JavaScript code in multiple files with using webpack


* What is Functional Programming ?
-> is one of the type of programming paradigms
-> Programming paradigms are the "methods" or we can say a set of rules to structure our code and to solve a problem
-> Procedural | Logical | Functional | Object-Oriented Programming

function greeting() {
    return function() {
        return 'Good Morning';
    }
}

let anFunction = greeting();
let message = anFunction();

console.log(message);

//let message = greeting;

/* function printMessage(anFunction) {
    console.log(anFunction());
}

printMessage(message); */

* What is Pure Functions ?
Pure function is a function which always give same output if we give it the same input
